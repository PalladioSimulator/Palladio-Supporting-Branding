------------------------------------

Author: Sebastian Lehrig
Date: 2015/06/16

Other features using this feature as a "shared license" will "inherit" the attributes
configured in the feature.properties file.

Limitations:
- Does not work for the "sites to visit" attribute
- Does not work for branding
